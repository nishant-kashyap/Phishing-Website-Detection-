# Phishing-Website-Detection-
•In this project, various ML models are implemented for the problem of website phishing classification. The goal is to assess which machine learning approach is more    effective in identifying phishing websites using an actual dataset of 11,055 URLs gathered from the UCI machine learning repository.
•Five ML methods ( Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and Stacking Classifier) were used to achieve the goal. 
•There are a total of 30 distinct features that are used to identify whether a given website URL is legitimate or phishing.

# Results
•In this experiment, the XGBoost model’S testing accuracy of 97.42 % is highest, followed by the Stacking Classifier model with 96.29 %. Many machine learning methods for phishing website detection in the literature were outperformed by our results.
